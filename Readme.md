#### Link to the deployed project - https://big-trip-89prlju16-sanich123.vercel.app/

#### I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript(Object-oriented programming).

The application consists of two screens: "Travel Route" and "Statistics".

The journey is built from individual route points. A waypoint is a single event in a journey. A waypoint can be a stopover (Check-in, Sightseeing, Restaurant) or a vehicle ride (Taxi, Bus, Train, Ship, Drive, and Flight).

The following controls are available to the user in the form for creating a new waypoint: Save button. Saving a waypoint and closing the form for creating a waypoint. Cancel button. Cancel changes and close the form for creating a waypoint.

The application provides several filters: Everything - a complete list of waypoints; Future - a list of planned waypoints, i.e. points whose event start date is greater than or equal to the current date; Past - a list of passed route points, i.e. points whose route end date is less than the current one.

The user has the ability to sort waypoints by cost (click on the heading of the "Price" column) and duration (click on the heading of the "Time" column). Sorting works in one direction - from maximum to minimum: when sorting by cost, the most expensive route points will be at the beginning of the list, when sorting by duration, the longest ones.

If you want to, you can:

clone this project ('git clone [name of repository]'),
navigate into project's folder ('cd [folder's name]')
install dependencies ('npm i'),
and run the project with 'npm run start' script.
